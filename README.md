# DISCO: Distilling Phrasal Counterfactuals with Large Language Models

This is the public codebase for arxiv paper: [DISCO: Distilling Phrasal Counterfactuals with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10534)

DISCO is a framework for automatically generating high-quality counterfactual data at scale. The system elicite counterfactual perturbations by prompting a large general language model like GPT-3. Then, a task-specific teacher model filters the generation to distill high-quality counterfactual data.
